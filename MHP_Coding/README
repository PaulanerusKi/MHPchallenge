This project is a simple example of how I would fetch a API and display it in the DOM.
It uses Javascript, HTML, CSS, VUE (cdn) and parcel as a bundler.

The requirements were the following: 

- Single Page Application
- Show all GOT Houses 
- Details on demand about the houses when clicked  
- Usage of a Framework (Vue cdn) 
- Usage of a Bundler (Parcel) 
- Usage of Version-control (Github)

The solution is limited to the basic requirements. 

The following sources have been used: 
The API:https://anapioficeandfire.com/
The background image: https://jooinn.com/dark-wood.html 
The Font is from: https://www.fonts4free.net/game-of-thrones-font.html
As inspiration to fetch the paginated API: https://dev.to/nirmal_kumar/retrieve-entire-data-from-paginated-api-recursively-3pl4
